# Music 101 with JS Bach

[Repo for my talk from Frontend Connect 2019](https://frontend-con.io/speakers-2/#craig)

> 🎶MUSIC 🎶 is a powerful, dynamic programming language, which can be used to create truly transformative experiences! Unfortunately, it’s been hindered by convoluted syntax and centuries of technical debt, which can lead to some performance issues…
>
> 🎷🎺🎻 Let’s tear music apart, and use a little bit of physics 🏹, a little bit of math 📊, and a whole lot of JavaScript 💻to re-invent the building blocks of the greatest hits of the last 400 years 🎹!
>
> Together we will re-implement the primitive components of musical theory, like pitch ⚾️, rhythm 🥁and harmony 🎤, and discover yet another reason to prefer composition over inheritance.
