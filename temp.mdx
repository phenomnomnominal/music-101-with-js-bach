# Chords

So far, we discussed the relationships between pairs of pitches.

We've talked about their positions relative to each other in scales, and how they work as intervals.

We've named some of those intervals, and given them descriptions like "Major" and "Minor".

Most of the same principles apply to chords as well.

A chord is three or more notes played at the same time.

Let's look at the chromatic scale again, this time based on the note of C - the "root" note, or "tonic" of the scale.

C - Db - D - Eb - E - F - Gb - G - Ab - A - Bb - B - C

Any combination of these notes will create a chord. All these chords will have their own name, and sound, and their own use in music.

Some combinations of these notes are more common than others.
---# Using triads

So how do we use these triads?

In western music, specifically western popular music, four of these chords are the most common.

If you've ever heard of "four chord" songs, chances are the chords that were used were:

I triad
IV triad
V triad
VI triad

In the C major scale, those triads are

C
F
G
Am

---It is pretty common to play these chords in the following order:

I V VI IV

C G Am F

As you can hear, they just kind of _work_ - and sound pretty familiar to modern ears.

Let's talk about relative keys again.

We talked about C major having the following notes,

C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C

And A minor being its relative minor key with the following notes

A - B - C - D - E - F - G - A

If we go through the process of triad building again, we get the _same chords_, but with different numbers

A C D - I Am
B D F - II BÂ°
C E G - III C
D F A - IV Dm
E G B - V E
F A C - VI F
G B D - VII G
A C E - I Am

Finding our four chords again, we get

I Am
III C
VI F
VII G

It is pretty common to hear them in the following order:

I VI III VII

Am F C G Am F

     I V VII IV

Which is the same progression, just started from the middle!

This is the foundation of so much modern popular music. These four traid chords, based on different keys, with different melodies.

# RECAP

We started with noise. Noise is chaotic.

But noise is also energy, energy that is carried by a wave.

The ammount of energy that a wave carries is controlled the _amplitude_ of the wave.

When we control how much energy a wave has, we subdivide a wave along the vertical axis, and we create dynamics.

A sound wave cannot exist in one dimension. The second dimension is time.

We subdivide the wave along the horizontal dimension to give it structure.

We count the repeating patterns in the structure of time.

In music, we measure the frequency of these repetitions in beats per minute.

In physics, we measure the frequency in Hertz.

We can use machines to count beats for us.

For low frequencies, we can differentiate between those beats.

As the beat gets faster, our ears can no longer tell them apart.

And rhythm turns in pitch.

The faster the rhythm, the higher the pitch.

We subdivide pitch to give it structure.

Pythagoras gave us a pretty good system for dividing pitch using the 3:2 ratio

We divide pitch into the 12(ish) notes of the chromatic scale.

But the world doesn't work perfectly with maths, so we had to tweak the system a bit.

Johann Sebastian Bach took this improved system and produced some of the worlds most incredible music.

Composers have taken inspiration from Bach for the last quarter of a millenium.

And now we used some of his tricks to write a pop loop.

Thank you, I hope you enjoed it.
